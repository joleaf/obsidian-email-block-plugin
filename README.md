This plugin lets you plan small emails inside your [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) notes.

## Install ..

### .. automatically in Obsidian

1. Go to **Community Plugins** in your Obsidian Settings and **disable** Safe Mode
2. Click on **Browse** and search for "Email Block"
3. Click install
4. Toggle the plugin on in the **Community Plugins** tab

### .. manually from this repo

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/joleaf/obsidian-email-block-plugin/releases) `*.zip` file.
2. Unpack the zip in the `.obsidan/plugins` folder of your obsidian vault

## How to use

Add the "email" code block into your note:

... with plain text as body content:

````
```email
to: info@randommail.com
subject: My Subject
body: "Hey info,

  here is some content"
```
````

... with a referenced note as body content:

````
```email
to: info@randommail.com
subject: My Subject
body: [[MyMail4711]]
variables:
  myvar: TestVar
```
````

You can use the `variables` parameter to replace placeholders in your body text with the variable values.
To include a variable in the body text just add a placeholder `{{myvar}}`.
Variables from fontmatter data can be used as well.

... with a body text after the yaml:

````
```email
to: info@randommail.com
subject: Hello World
---
Hi there,
this is my new body
Best!
JB
```
````

... you can use properties, like variables, on the subject or within the body:

````
```email
to: info@randommail.com
subject: reminder for {{name}}
---
Dear {{name}},
this is not a personal email.
Regards,
FI
```
````
